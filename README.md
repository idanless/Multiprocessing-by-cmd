# Multiprocessing-by-cmd

Hallo 
before I go to my vacation they ask me if can send API to some web system because it was a lot of devices to send and my pc was not have powershell (not web pack) and not python i develop "cmd as Multiprocessing" using curl.exe 
what i did is send curl using cmd to the background and control how much "processing" i want running  in the same time this was "creative" way to do it fast and finish the job and go to my   vacation
<BR>
 to do it first all i cerate cmd the contains the bin of curl and what if need to do 
for example:
@ECHO off
curl.exe  google.com
timeout /T 1
