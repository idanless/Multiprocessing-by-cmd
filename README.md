# Multiprocessing-by-cmd

<p>Hallo <br />before I go to my vacation they ask me if can send API to some web system because it was a lot of devices to send and my pc was not have powershell (not web pack) and not python i develop "cmd as Multiprocessing" using curl.exe <br />what i did is send curl using cmd to the background and control how much "processing" i want running in the same time this was "creative" way to do it fast and finish the job and go to my vacation</p>
<p><br /> to do it first all i cerate cmd the contains the bin of curl and what i need he do <br />for example:<br />@ECHO off<br />curl.exe google.com<br />timeout /T 1</p>
